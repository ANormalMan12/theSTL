# mySTL

## Introduction

I am trying to learn about how to write better codes. If you would like to join or come up with issues, it would be appreciated.

## Goal

The project aims to make a simple but well documented STL. The STL would not be a copy of real STL,but a result of our process of learning data structures.


Thank you for reading my codes.
